Based on the suggestions from the CMT Community, the CyberMiles Foundation would like to initiate a community vote on whether we should support DPoS staking from the CMT Wallet. 

The voting rules are as follows. 


* CMT Wallet is the only tool to vote;
* To participate in voting, you should hold at least 1,000 CMTs;
* 1 CMT per vote;
* Each CMT address can only vote once;


The CyberMiles Foundation will **take a snapshot of all CMT addresses on 2 AM, April 13 (UTC)**. Exchange addresses can't participate in the vote. Please make sure your CMTs are kept in you CMT Wallet before the snapshot.

This community vote will **start on 6 AM, April 14，and end on 2 AM, April 17(UTC)**. You can scan a QR code or open the Community Vote DApp in CMT Wallet to vote.
